With respect to the general characteristics of a model, what best describes Mapping ?
.Models are not inherently assigned to a specific original. They are utilized by a model-using subject within a particular time frame "and within the constraints of certain conceptual or actual operations."
.Models contain only those attributes of the corresponding original which are relevant to the modeler and the intended model user.
..Models are always mappings (representations of real or abstract originals, which may, in turn, be models themselves.
With respect to the general characteristics of a model, what best describes Reduction ?

When mapping and reducing the reality in a model, we distinguish between...
..Structural, functional and behavioural similarity.
.Probable, improbable and plausible concepts.
.Business oriented, transitional and infrastructure oriented relevance.
Statement: "A model us a generalized representation of a piece of reality, with only relevant real-world properties taken into account during modeling"
..True
.False
Statement: "Modeling means essentially to describe a set of abstract or concrete phenomena in a structured and, eventually in a formal way. Describing, modeling and drawing is a key technique to support human understanding, reasoning and communication"
..True
.False
In the context of the derivation and analysis process during modeling "Defining the problem and the purpose of the model" means ...
..The task, and therefore the problem to be solved, must be clearly defined and should form the basis for defining the purpose of the model
.It is essential to define what is part of the model or problem, and what is not. When developing medium or long-term enterprise strategy, for example, detailed planning may be potentially be left out
.When modeling an overall structure of an organization, the model should only record important objects, such as departments, roles, and locations, and how they interrelate
.A model should be tailored to the model users as well as the problem and purpose
In the context of the derivation and analysis process during modeling "Delimiting the problem" means ...

Statement: "Enterprise Architecture is only about modeling the components that make up the application and infrastructure and how those components inter-relate"
.True
..False
The common ways of representing an enterprise model are:
.Abstract, concrete and predictive
.From the stakeholder's view, from the implementer's view and the worker's view
..Textual description, tabular representation, informal graphic representation and formal graphic representation
Everyone who have an indirect or direct interest in modeling or the results, are regarded as stakeholders in a modeling process
..True
.False
Internal stakeholders include...
..Include employees, project team, the departments concerned, the managers, and executives
.Include customers, partners, subcontractors, legislators and shareholders of the enterprise
External stakeholders include...
.Include employees, project team, the departments concerned, the managers, and executives
..Include customers, partners, subcontractors, legislators and shareholders of the enterprise
The 8 most important perspectives when evaluating models in Krogstie's view are:
..Behavioral
.Predictive
..Functional
..Structural
.Conceptual
..Goal- and rule oriented
..Object-oriented
..(Social) Communication
..Actor/role oriented
..Topological
In the IDEF0 process model, in addition to the inputs, we have...
.Stakeholders, influencers and consequences
..Controls, Mechanisms and Outputs
.Behaviours, Inflictions and Results
.Outputs, Controllers and Maintenance
IDEF0 is very effective in detailing a systems activities for functional modelling, and provides an overall very concise description of systems, by defining input, output, mechanism, and controls. Because of the hierarchy structure, itâ€™s easily re- fineable by removing, adding or changing processes.
..True
.False
IDEF0 can be so concise that only domain experts understands the model, it can be misinterpreted as containing a strict series of activities, and it has limited support for the behavioural perspective.
..True
.False
The SeeMe modeling language consists of these main components:
.Objects, Subjects, Actions and Consequences
..Roles, activities and entities
.Stakeholders, Systems, Documents and Operators
.Unicorns, Beavers, Level 9000 Warlocks and Invisible snakes
