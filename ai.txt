What describes an agents actions in a deterministic environment?
.There is uncertainty about the outcome of an action.
..Any action has a single guaranteed effect without uncertainty.
.Any action has a single guaranteed effect, with the exception of possible effects from other agents.

.There is uncertainty about the outcome of an action.
.Any action has a single guaranteed effect without uncertainty.
..Any action has a single guaranteed effect, with the exception of possible effects from other agents.
